        <p>The notion 'textual history' (Sw. texthistoria) has often been used in a narrow philological sense denoting the history of the editions of a single work. Nowadays, at least in the Nordic languages, the notion can also be used in other connections, not the least within discourse analysis. The article shows that textual history theoretically could be understood in any of the following ways: 1) the history of text(s) as language in use, whether concerning the text-linguistic resources as such or a specific category of texts or - as often within philology - just one work in its different editions, 2) the external history of the production and use of text(s) as language in use (e.g. literacy), 3) the history of texts as external events (e.g. historical discourse analysis), and 4) the external history of text production and reception (especially the traditional history of literature). The diverse meanings of the notion 'textual history' make it less readily understandable and thus difficult to use. It is, however, suggested that perhaps the most expedient usage is that of type 3: 'history of texts as external events', though then in obvious contrast to the widespread philological one within type 1. Textual history would therefore also be something more than merely (a part of) language history; it is a research field in its own right.
